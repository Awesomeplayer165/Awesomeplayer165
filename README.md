### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for _checking_ out my GitHub profile! I'm a Software Developer, and most of my work resides in FOSS. I have 8+ years of experience learning and using Python and just over 2+ years with Swift.

Lately, I've been putting my little software development knowledge to use by creating [Fume AQI](https://fumeaqi.page.link/AppStore), a real-time air quality app that fetches Purple Air AQI data and displays it in an extremely user-friendly interface. Fume AQI is programmed in `Xcode`, `UIKit`, and `SwiftUI`
