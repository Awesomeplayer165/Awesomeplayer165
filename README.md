### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for _checking_ out my GitHub profile! I'm a Software Developer, and most of my work resides in FOSS. I have 8+ years of experience learning and using Python and just over 2+ years with Swift.

Lately, I've been putting my little software development knowledge to use by creating [Fume AQI](https://fumeaqi.page.link/AppStore), a real-time air quality app that fetches Purple Air AQI data and displays it in an extremely user-friendly interface. Fume AQI is programmed through `Xcode` and `UIKit` - I still cannot wrap my head around `SwiftUI` yet!

With my inspiration being [Floating Panel](https://github.com/scenee/FloatingPanel) by [scenee](https://github.com/scenee), I brought myself into the friendly and helpful FOSS community by creating [PillboxView](https://github.com/Awesomeplayer165/PillboxView) and [AuthenticationCheck](https://github.com/Awesomeplayer165/AuthenticationCheck).
> Note: Both are documented through [DocC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/docc).

Thanks for checking this out!
